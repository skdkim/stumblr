## Questions

- ~~why does pressing enter not submit the search form?~~
  - because it was just an input field, not a form -- had to wrap it in form tags
- ~~is there a way to check the HashHistory contents?~~
  - ~~is this bad practice?~~
  - there isn't since it's an ajax request
  - pass explore param instead
    - within the client actions fetch action
- ~~audio posts don't play until after refresh~~
  - cloudinary just being slow
- more reliable way to choose whether to add `<pre>` tag to text post's body?
