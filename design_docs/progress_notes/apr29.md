## Questions

- how does `componentWillMount` work differently than `onEnter` hooks? -- why is it not still fetching?
- how to make/add tags when submitted with posts; where should the new tag be created, if necessary? what about the tagging?
- how to make page autofocus on form (html tag doesn't seem to work)
- how to iterate through background image urls and interpolate into CSS
- how to get `placeholder` in `textarea` to be at top on `TextForm` (and other similar forms)
- how to make new post form render within dashboard when button is clicked
- how/where does filtering occur? (e.g. for a user to only see posts of people they follow, and for posts tagged with searched tag)

## In Progress

- make `Posts` components
  - ~~different form for every type of posts~~
- need to test all `Posts` actions
- cloudinary image hosting -- integrate with photo form and post request
